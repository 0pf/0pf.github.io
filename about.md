A Public Benefit Nonprofit Organization: Open Processor Foundation (OPF) is a public benefit nonprofit organization dedicated to promote the universal freedom to create, distribute, and modify microprocessor design. The first open source CPU core this forum is providing is called the “J1 core” together with associated logic. The planned release date is March, 2015. It will be easily and available for your use and to initiate your imagination. We hope you will join this forum and this exciting opportunity.

### Clean-Room Design

 J series processors leverages 20+ year old technologies and cutting edge design tools, process and methodologies. J series processors are  designed through clean-room design process to respect the original manufacturers’ copyrights, trade secret, and trademark. J series users can leverage software tools, OSes and applications accumulated over 20 years.

### Patents  

We believe that from 2014 J series processor cores can be deployed worldwide. World Trade Organization (WTO) implemented an uniform patent system worldwide, and a patent expires 20 years after application date. Thereafter its disclosure becomes public domain.  A technological artifact older than 20+ years predates all patents. J series processors can be distributed because of this patents’ basic principle. OPF will have its own patent pool to cross license newer patents so newer technologies can also be pursued. 

### Architectural Validation and Certification Process   

OPF will administer functional validation process to ensure that open sourcing will not cause technology fragmentations. All J series implementation needs to pass architectural validation including OPF validation suite, OS bring up tests, and debugger tests. For architectural extensions OPF has Architectural Committee which includes most original architects to  architectural validations, certifications, and plan for future architectural extensions . 

### Network with Original Device and OS Manufacturers   

We collaborate with the original manufacturer of SuperH architecture. Hitachi developed SuperH architecture in 1990s. OCF plans to collaborate with Renesas a plan to have Linux Foundation reinstate J/SuperH OS support. SuperH was marked orphan by Linux Foundation since February, 2014 and now in Linux Orphanarium due to manufacturer’s inability to keep the cross tool current with Linux releases. We are also having discussions with Microsoft and QNX who only support this architecture to Windows Embedded Auto 7 and QNX 6.5. Obviously we need to set up commercial reasons to restart the support. 

### Networking Larger Open Source ISA and Processor Core Groups   

We plan to collaborate with RISC5 team at University of California at Berkeley who started RISC movement in early 1980s which inspired SuperH architecture. Current discussion is to share the logic device fabric and methodology. We also plan to start a dialog with OpenRISC folks. 

### Why are We Doing This? 

For over 50+ years we were blessed with Gordon Moore’s Law which states that the semiconductor performance doubles every 18 months. This created circular logic among financial investors, proprietary logic technology providers and manufacturing equipment technology providers, application software providers, consumers in market, and then finally financial investors.  Now they say Moore’s Law is coming to an end and this circular logic no longer seem to work. OCF feels we need to have another scenario of exponential growth through Network Effect. Network effect relies on the law of combinatorial growth is exponential as the nodes grows linearly. Most innovations combines previous innovations. For this to happen the new innovators need to have access to the previous technology. We believe open sourcing processors is one of the many ways to bring continued exponential growth in semiconductor industry.
