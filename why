For over 50+ years we were blessed with Gordon Moore’s Law which states that the semiconductor performance doubles every 18 months. This created circular logic among financial investors, proprietary logic technology providers and manufacturing equipment technology providers, application software providers, consumers in market, and then finally financial investors.

Now they say Moore’s Law is coming to an end and this circular logic no longer seem to work. OCF feels we need to have another scenario of exponential growth through Network Effect. Network effect relies on the law of combinatorial growth is exponential as the nodes grows linearly. Most innovations combines previous innovations. For this to happen the new innovators need to have access to the previous technology. We believe open sourcing processors is one of the many ways to bring continued exponential growth in semiconductor industry.
